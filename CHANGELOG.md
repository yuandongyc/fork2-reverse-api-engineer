# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Chrome DevTools MCP agent provider (`chrome-mcp`)**: Agent mode can drive the browser through [Chrome DevTools MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-devtools-mcp) (`--autoConnect`, optional `--no-usage-statistics`) with a dedicated system prompt and SDK wiring alongside the existing Playwright MCP path

### Changed
- **Agent provider selection**: CLI settings and mode flow distinguish **auto (Playwright MCP)** from **chrome-mcp (Chrome DevTools MCP)**
- **Packaging**: Source distributions exclude local demo video, packed Chrome extension zip, store-asset screenshots, and per-machine `.claude/settings.local.json` files so PyPI artifacts stay small (wheel unchanged: `src/reverse_api` only)

### Fixed
- **Tool result blocks** (engineer / agent streaming): When `content` is empty, fall back to `result` or `output` on tool-result blocks so alternate SDK shapes still surface output in the UI and message store
- **Process title**: Set when the CLI module loads so the terminal shows `reverse-api` earlier in startup
- **Follow-up prompt**: Flush local sync before reading follow-up input so state is up to date
- **Tests**: `ClaudeAutoEngineer` analyze tests now use real `claude_agent_sdk` message types (so `isinstance` checks in the streaming loop match) and stub `_prompt_follow_up` to avoid the interactive follow-up path

### Documentation
- **README**: Agent mode demo GIF

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Follow-up chat**: After a run completes, type follow-up messages to iterate in the same session without creating new run IDs or folders. Press Enter to finish
- **Abort run (Ctrl+C)**: Gracefully cancel a running agent/engineer session and return to the REPL instead of exiting the app
- **AskUserQuestion free mode**: All select/checkbox prompts now include "Other (type your answer)" so users can always provide free-text input. Updated agent prompt to document free-form, multi-select, and multi-question capabilities
- **Random task suggestions (Ctrl+R)**: Press Ctrl+R in agent mode to fill the prompt with a random curated task idea. Press again to cycle

### Fixed
- **Usage tracking across follow-ups**: Token counts now accumulate across all turns in a session instead of being overwritten by the last turn
- **Agent mode follow-up**: Auto engineer (agent mode) was using a copy-pasted streaming loop without follow-up support; now reuses the shared conversation loop

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Stream closed errors (#51)**: Reverted from `query()` to `ClaudeSDKClient` which maintains a persistent bidirectional connection, eliminating "Error in hook callback hook_0: Stream closed" errors. The original AUQ fix (v0.4.3) unnecessarily switched APIs — only the `can_use_tool` callback signature needed updating
- **CLAUDECODE env var leak**: Clear inherited `CLAUDECODE` env var from CLI subprocess to prevent nested session interference when running inside Claude Code
- **CLI stderr noise**: Filter minified JS stack traces into a single clean error line (use `DEBUG=1` for full output)

### Changed
- **claude-agent-sdk**: Bumped minimum version to 0.1.48
- **Agent mode**: No longer prompts for URL (agent navigates autonomously)
- **Header UI**: Version and task labels now use mode-specific colors (agent=coral, engineer=blue, collector=gold)

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Stream closed errors (#51)**: Partial fix using `query()` with env var workarounds (superseded by v0.4.5)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **AskUserQuestion interactive prompt**: Fixed interactive questionary UI not rendering in engineer and agent modes. Switched from `ClaudeSDKClient` to `query()` function, as `ClaudeSDKClient` silently auto-approves `AskUserQuestion` without triggering the `can_use_tool` callback

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Engineer client resolution**: Prefer the active engineer client recorded in session history over config defaults, preventing iterative edits from switching to the wrong file when multiple language clients exist

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **`show` CLI subcommand**: View details of a specific run by ID
- **Chrome Extension improvements**: Multi-session support, codegen recording, side panel UX overhaul

  - Bundle size reduced from 1112KB to 436KB (removed shiki, lucide-react, ansi-to-react, @base-ui/react)
- **Mintlify API client example**

### Changed
- **Background update check**: Version check now runs in a background thread to avoid blocking CLI startup

### Fixed
- **Engineer language preservation**: Iterative edits now preserve the original output language instead of resetting
- **Native host Gatekeeper handling**: Scoped xattr to the actual claude-code package directory
- **Codegen selector escaping**: Dynamic attribute values now escaped with CSS.escape() to prevent broken selectors
- **Chrome Extension manifest**: Removed unused `scripting` permission; pinned devicon CDN to v2.16.0

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **`list` CLI subcommand**: Non-interactive command to list generated scripts and runs
  - Rich table output (compact and full modes) and JSON output (`--json`)
